#Â Show/Hide

## Rules

Aim for non-essential content to be hidden, but essential content can be "alluded" to with the trigger text

Should be used for a paragraph or two of text, (i.e. not just a few words, and not a whole page worth of content)

Can show/hide multiple at once

The trigger link should be in context to the content (rather than just 'Click here', it could have the first part of the text)
