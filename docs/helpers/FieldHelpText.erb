# This needs some thought - how do we tie this to an input field?
#
# The input will need `aria-describedby` attribute to be added
# and have a value of the ID of the field_help_text. (In this case tip_credit_repayments).

<%= field_help_text "Please enter your first name",
    html: {
      id: 'tip_credit_repayments'
    }
%>
