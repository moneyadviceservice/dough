### Inset Block

Last edited 10 September 2014

This is a dummy component and shouldn't be used. It's only for **demo**.

The primary goal of the module tabs UI pattern is to permit users to view a group of
related data one at a time.

#### How to use this component

- Tabs should not wrap, but when they do they will turn into a dropdown.
- Not explicitly used to indicate progress, but can help user  understand the breadth
of content on the page.
- Tabs should not show results, so summary of results should be outside. For
example a form's inputs can be broken down into tabs, with the summary/results
of the form shown outside as a separate component.
- One tab should not rely on another tab to make sense.

##### Examples of where this component is used

##### JavaScript notes

This element turns into a list when javascript is disabled.
