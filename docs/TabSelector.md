## Tabs

last edited 10 Sep 2014

### Definition
A module tab is a User Interface (UI) design pattern where content is separated into different panes, and each pane is viewable one at a time. The user requests content to be displayed by clicking (or in some instances hovering over) the content’s corresponding tab control

### Rules
* Tabs should not wrap, but when they do they will turn into a mobile friendly dropdown
* Tabs should not be be used to indicate progress, but can help users understand the breadth of content on the page
* Tabs should not contain the end or final result, these should be outside of any tabs. For example a form's inputs can be contained within tabs with the summary or results shown outside of these as a separate component
* One tab should not rely on another tab to make sense

### Examples

Although no sites are using the Dough helper yet, they are using the static HTML version. You can see an example in the [Money Advice Service's styleguide](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/styleguide/components/common#section-tab-selector).
